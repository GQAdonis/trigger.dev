## Deployment

Running the [trigger.dev deploy] command builds and deploys your code. Sometimes there can be issues building your code. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### `Typecheck failed, aborting deployment`

We typecheck your code before deploying. If the typecheck fails, the deployment is aborted. You should see logs with details about the typecheck failure.

You can skip typechecking, by adding the `--skip-typecheck` flag when calling deploy.

### `Error: Cannot find module 'X'`

This errors occurs if we want figure out how to automatically import some code. You can fix this by adding it the `dependenciesToBundle` array in the [trigger.config file](/v3/trigger-config).

Like this:

```ts trigger.config.ts
import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const config: TriggerConfig = {
  //..other stuff
  //either regex or strings of package names
  dependenciesToBundle: [/@sindresorhus/, "escape-string-regexp"],
};
```

### `Failed to build project image: Error building image`

### `Deployment timed out`
